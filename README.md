a.	Making sure the free block list contains ALL of the free blocks

b.	Make sure than there are no files/directories stored on items listed in the free block list

4)	Each directory contains . and .. and their block numbers are correct

5)	Each directoryâ€™s link count matches the number of links in the filename_to_inode_dict

6)	If the data contained in a location pointer is an array, that indirect is one

7)	That the size is valid for the number of block pointers in the location array. The three possibilities are:

a.	size<blocksize if  indirect=0 and size>0

b.	size<blocksize*length of location array if indirect!=0

c.	size>blocksize*(length of location array-1) if indirect !=0
